## My Portfolio

Hi there! I'll be posting some projects about Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI in general.

### [Project 1: Color Classification on E-commerce Clothes](https://github.com/YanisNC/Color-Classification-E-commerce-Clothes/blob/main/Color_Classification_on_E_commerce_Clothes.ipynb)
- To face this unsupervised learning problem, I've used a dataset that contains 5000 unlabeled images.
- I've used the K-Means algorithm to cluster the N dominant colors of the images.
- Finally, we use a threshold, in the HSV color space, for the color that we want to detect from all the clothes.
- If any of the N dominant colors is inside this threshold, it's classified as this color.

### [Project 2: How Covid Affected Banking Transactions](https://github.com/YanisNC/AI-things/blob/master/Covid%20Banking%20Transactions.ipynb)
- Analyzed what purchasing categories have been most affected by Covid (positively and negatively).

### [Project 3: Titanic Kaggle Competition](https://github.com/YanisNC/AI-things/blob/master/Titanic_Kaggle.ipynb)
- Preprocessed the data
- Created some data visualizations
- Trained the model using Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Got 82.56% of accuracy

### [Project 4: SVM on Cats dataset](https://github.com/YanisNC/AI-things/blob/master/Cats%20SVM.ipynb)
- Created some data visualizations
- Trained the model using SVM
- Used the Linear, RBF and Polynomial kernel
- Got 79% of accuracy using RBF kernel
